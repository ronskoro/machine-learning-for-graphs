# Machine Learning for Graphs and Sequential Data Projects

This repository contains a collection of exercises focused on machine learning techniques for graphs and sequential data. The exercises cover a range of topics relevant to machine learning for graphs and sequential data.

## Get started

To get started, simply clone or download this repository and navigate to the exercise you are interested in. Each exercise includes a dataset and the necessary files to run the machine learning models. The files include my work based on the summer semester course: Machine Learning for Graphs and Sequential Data, Technical University Munich.

To run any of the projects, navigate towards the exercise you are interested in and download the requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Topics Covered

The included projects cover a range of topics relevant to machine learning for graphs and sequential data, including:

- Hidden markov models
- Graph neural networks
- Time series analysis
- Sequence prediction
- Recurrent neural networks
- Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks
- And more!
